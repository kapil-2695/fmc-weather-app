## My process
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS `clamp()` function
- CSS media query
- React library (state, effect, ref, )


### What I learned

- I learned to to build a full working app with react library.
- I learned to apply the concepts learned in react to maintain state, fetch information from the api.
- I learned to make use of the external API for getting weather data, location infomation using reverse geocoding api, and to get the search reuslts.
